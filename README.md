# Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-GGUF

## Introduction

Qwen2.5 is the latest series of Qwen large language models. For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:

- Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.
- Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.
- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.
- **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. 

**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 3B Qwen2.5 model in the GGUF Format**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, Attention QKV bias and tied word embeddings
- Number of Parameters: 3.09B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 2.77B
- Number of Layers: 36
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 16 for Q and 2 for KV
- Context Length: Full 32,768 tokens and generation 8192 tokens
- Quantization: q2_K, q3_K_M, q4_0, q4_K_M, q5_0, q5_K_M, q6_K, q8_0

For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Quickstart

Check out our [llama.cpp documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html) for more usage guide.

We advise you to clone [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and install it following the official guide. We follow the latest version of llama.cpp. 
In the following demonstration, we assume that you are running commands under the repository `llama.cpp`.

Since cloning the entire repo may be inefficient, you can manually download the GGUF file that you need or use `huggingface-cli`:
1. Install
   ```shell
   pip install -U huggingface_hub
   ```
2. Download:
   ```shell
   huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-GGUF qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
   ```

For users, to achieve chatbot-like experience, it is recommended to commence in the conversation mode:

```shell
./llama-cli -m <gguf-file-path> \
    -co -cnv -p "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant." \
    -fa -ngl 80 -n 512
```


## Evaluation & Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [ðŸ“‘ blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/).

For quantized models, the benchmark results against the original bfloat16 models can be found [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/quantization_benchmark.html)

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).
